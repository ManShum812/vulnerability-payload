ServiceNow Vulnerability Ticket: Stored XSS Vulnerability

Title: Stored XSS Vulnerability in First Name Field on abc.com

Description: A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered on abc.com. This issue occurs in the "First Name" field under the "Personal Information" section of user profiles. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts that execute when the profile page is viewed.

Severity: High

Affected URL:
https://abc.com/group/dada

Steps to Reproduce:

Log in to your account on abc.com.
Navigate to https://abc.com/group/dada.
In the PERSONAL INFORMATION section, enter <script>alert(1)</script> in the First Name field and click Save.
Go back to the main page at https://abc.com.
Observe that an XSS alert window pops up, indicating that the script has been executed.
Impact:

Malicious scripts could be executed in the context of another userâ€™s session.
Potential data theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities could occur.
Recommended Remediation:

Input Validation & Output Encoding:

Apply server-side input validation to prevent any malicious scripts from being accepted.
Use appropriate encoding (e.g., HTML encoding) when displaying user-supplied content on the page to ensure scripts are not executed.
Content Security Policy (CSP):

Implement a strict Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the sources of scripts that can be executed on the page.
Access Control:

Limit access to the /group/dada endpoint so that only admin users can access this section. Ensure proper role-based access control is implemented to prevent unauthorized access.
User Role Restrictions:

Restrict the ability to modify the "Personal Information" section to authorized users only. Implement role-based permissions to ensure that regular users cannot alter sensitive fields.
Security Headers:

Use security headers like X-XSS-Protection and X-Content-Type-Options to enhance security against potential XSS attacks.
Sanitization Libraries:

Utilize trusted sanitization libraries such as DOMPurify (for JavaScript) or OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer (for Java) to ensure any HTML content is sanitized before being rendered on the page.
Regular Security Audits:

Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix any potential XSS vulnerabilities across the application.
