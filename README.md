Title: Missing HSTS Header on All Endpoints of abc.com

Description: All endpoints on abc.com are missing the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header. The absence of this header increases the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks by allowing HTTP connections or SSL stripping, potentially exposing sensitive data.

Severity: Medium

Affected URLs:
https://abc.com/*

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a browser and navigate to any endpoint on https://abc.com (e.g., https://abc.com/group/dada).
2. Use tools or a security testing tool (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) to inspect the HTTP response headers.
3. Observe that the Strict-Transport-Security header is missing from the response.

Impact:

Users may be susceptible to SSL stripping attacks, where an attacker downgrades the secure HTTPS connection to an unencrypted HTTP connection.
Sensitive data transmitted between the client and server could be intercepted or manipulated by an attacker.
Recommended Remediation:

Implement HSTS Header:

Add the Strict-Transport-Security header to all HTTPS responses from the server. A recommended value is:
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload

Enable HSTS Preload:

Submit the domain abc.com to the HSTS preload list to ensure that all modern browsers automatically enforce HSTS for your domain.

Verify HTTPS Configuration:

Ensure that all subdomains also support HTTPS and serve the HSTS header with the includeSubDomains directive.
