Ticket Title: Duplicate X-XSS-Protection Header Detected in HTTP Response for http://google.com/*

Description:
During a recent security assessment, all endpoints under http://google.com/* were found to return two X-XSS-Protection headers in the HTTP response. The presence of duplicate security headers can cause ambiguity in how the browser interprets the header values, potentially leading to security bypass or undefined behavior. This misconfiguration may weaken the protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Details:

Affected URL(s): All endpoints under http://google.com/*
Header Misconfiguration: Duplicate X-XSS-Protection headers.


Risk: The X-XSS-Protection header is designed to instruct the browser to enable or disable built-in XSS protection mechanisms. Having conflicting values, such as one header enabling protection and the other disabling it, may result in the browser ignoring the header or applying inconsistent protection. This inconsistency could lead to exposure to XSS vulnerabilities.

Recommendation:  Ensure that only one X-XSS-Protection header is sent in the HTTP response for each endpoint.

Additional Information: Testing revealed that this issue affects all HTTP responses under http://google.com/*. It is recommended to validate all HTTP headers for misconfigurations across the site.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Send a request to any endpoint under http://google.com/*.
2. Inspect the HTTP response headers.
3. Observe the presence of two X-XSS-Protection headers with conflicting values.
