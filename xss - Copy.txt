Short Description:
Self-XSS vulnerability in the daf parameter of the POST endpoint at abc.com/a.html.

Description:
A self-XSS vulnerability has been identified in the daf parameter of the POST method at the endpoint abc.com/a.html. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which could lead to potential security risks if leveraged by a malicious actor.

Reproduction Steps:

1. Navigate to abc.com/a.html.

2. contain a single quote (') in Zions Buy section but then clicked "Update"

3. Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept the request.

4. Modify the daf parameter value to <script>alert(1)</script>

5. Forward the request.

6. Observe that an XSS window pops up, confirming the presence of the self-XSS vulnerability.

Impact:
This self-XSS vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. While self-XSS typically requires user interaction, it can be exploited in social engineering attacks to escalate to more severe XSS vulnerabilities.

Recommended Mitigation:

Validate and sanitize user input on the server side to ensure that input cannot contain executable scripts.
Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of any XSS that may occur.
Encode data on output to ensure that any potentially harmful characters are rendered harmless by the browser.


Change the security risk to low because exploiting this self-XSS vulnerability is challenging; it requires the attacker to deceive the victim into manually copying and pasting the JavaScript code into the daf parameter value.
