Short Description:
CSRF Vulnerability on abc.com/aaa.html leading to unauthorized changes in the Zions Buy Zions Sell Drafts Spot Rate Minimum Denomination section.

Description:
A critical CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability has been identified on the page abc.com/aaa.html. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users, specifically changing the xyz section.

Details:

URL Affected: abc.com/aaa.html
Vulnerability Type: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
Vulnerable Section: xyz

Steps to Reproduce:

1. The victim logs into their account on abc.com.
2. The attacker creates a malicious webpage with a CSRF exploit that targets abc.com/aaa.html.
3. The victim, while logged in, visits the attacker's malicious webpage.
4. The exploit on the malicious page triggers an unauthorized action, altering the xyz section without the victim's consent.

Impact:
This vulnerability allows an attacker to change critical financial information on behalf of the authenticated user without their knowledge or consent. Such unauthorized changes can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage to the company.

Mitigation:
To protect against CSRF attacks and secure the page abc.com/aaa.html, implement the following measures:

1. Use CSRF Tokens:

Add a unique CSRF token to all forms and requests that change user data.
Ensure the server validates the CSRF token before processing the request.
CSRF tokens should be unique per session and user.

2. Validate Request Origins:

Verify the Origin and Referer headers of incoming POST requests to ensure they come from trusted sources (i.e., from the abc.com domain).
Reject requests that do not originate from the abc.com domain.

3. Implement SameSite Cookies:

Set the SameSite attribute on session cookies to Strict or Lax to prevent cookies from being sent with cross-site requests.
