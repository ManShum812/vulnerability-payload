
The vulnerability you described is commonly known as Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security. This type of vulnerability occurs when the application relies on client-side mechanisms (such as disabled form elements) to enforce security controls, which can be easily bypassed using tools like the browser's inspect element feature.

Short Description:
"View" boxes in account number are bypassable using browser inspect tool in the VIP Exceptions Management on abc.com

Issue Summary:
In the VIP Exceptions Management on abc.com, the "View" boxes for certain account numbers are disabled and should not be editable by users. However, these restrictions can be bypassed using the browser's inspect tool, allowing users to enable and check the "View" boxes, leading to unauthorized changes.

Details:

Application Affected: VIP Exceptions application
URL Affected: abc.com
Functionality Issue: Bypassing restrictions on "View" checkboxes

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Log in to the VIP Exceptions application on abc.com.

2. Enter 1130000002542473 in the Customer IBN search bar.

3. Notice that the "View" boxes for Account Numbers 5789507752 and 5789205845 are disabled.

4. Highlight the "View" checkbox for Account Number 5789507752, right-click, and select "Inspect" in your browser.

5. In the browser's Developer Tools, remove the disabled="true" attribute from the "View" checkbox.

6. Notice that you can now check the "View" box for Account Number 5789507752.

7. Check the "View" box and click on "Save."

8. Observe that a success message is displayed, indicating that the View Exception has been added to Account Number 5789507752.

9. Go back to Customer IBN 1130000002542473 and confirm that the "View" boxes are checked, indicating the change was successful.

Impact:
Users can bypass security restrictions and make unauthorized changes to the "View" boxes of account numbers. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential data breaches.

Mitigation:
Immediate investigation and resolution are required to prevent users from bypassing these restrictions. Possible steps include:

1. Server-Side Validation: Ensure that changes to the "View" boxes are validated server-side, not just client-side.

2. Disable Attribute Verification: Implement additional server-side checks to verify the disabled attribute and reject unauthorized changes.

3. User Interface Hardening: Prevent users from using browser tools to manipulate the DOM and bypass restrictions.
