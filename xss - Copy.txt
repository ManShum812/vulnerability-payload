Application Affected: VIP Exceptions application
URL Affected: abc.com

2. Attempt to log out by clicking the "Logout" button from the top right.

3. You will see a generic error message that says "Something went horribly wrong." If you return to the index page, you will notice that you are still logged in and have not been redirected back to the login page.

Mitigation:
Immediate investigation and resolution are required to restore the logout functionality. Possible steps include:

1. Review Logout Endpoint: Check the server-side implementation of the logout endpoint to ensure it invalidates the user's session correctly.

2. Inspect Client-Side Code: Verify that the client-side code (e.g., JavaScript) correctly triggers the logout request.

3. Session Management: Ensure that user sessions are properly managed and terminated upon logout.
